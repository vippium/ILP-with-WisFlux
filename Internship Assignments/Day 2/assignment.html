      <h2 id="what-is-html" style="background-color:peachpuff;">What is HTML ?</h2>
        <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create 
          and structure content on the web.</p>
        <p>HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define
           how it is structured and displayed by web browsers. It forms the building blocks of all websites 
           and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.</p>
           <p>I have divided HTML into two parts:
            <b><li>Basic HTML</li>
            <li>Advanced HTML</li></b></p>

        <h3><u>Basic HTML :</u></h3>
          <p>Every HTML document begins with a document type declaration, setting the foundation 
            for the webpage. This section introduces basic HTML tags that structure the page, such as 
            &lthead>, &ltbody>, and &ltp>. Although this is not mandatory, it is a good convention to 
              start the document with the below-mentioned tag.</p>
              <table>
                <tr>
                  <th>Tags</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&lthtml></td>
                  <td>Encloses the entire HTML document, serving as the root element for all HTML content.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&lthead></td>
                  <td>Contains header information about the webpage, including title, meta tags, and linked stylesheets.
                     It is part of the document’s structure but is not displayed on the webpage.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&lttitle></td>
                  <td>Used within the <head> section to define the title of the HTML document. It appears 
                    in the browser tab or window and provides a brief description of the webpage’s content.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&ltbody></td>
                  <td>Encloses the visible content of the webpage, such as text, images, audio, videos, 
                    and links. All elements within this tag are displayed on the actual webpage when viewed in a browser.</td>
                </tr>
              </table>

            <p>Other than this, these are the basic tags that are used in HTML:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Elements & Atrributes</li>
              <li>Form + Input type</li>
              <li>Tables</li>
              <li>Lists & Anchors</li>
              <li>Import and META tags</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <h3><u>Advanced HTML :</u></h3>
            <p>Advanced HTML refers to more complex HTML features and techniques that can improve 
              the performance, accessibility, interactivity, and SEO of web pages. Some examples of 
              advanced HTML include:
            <ul>
              <li>Canvas and SVG</li>
              <li>Web Storage</li>
            </ul></p>

            <h2 id="what-is-css" style="background-color:peachpuff;">What is CSS ?</h2>
            <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used
           to style and enhance website presentation.CSS is one of the main three 
           components of a webpage along with HTML and JavaScript. </p>
           <p>HTML adds Structure to a Webpage, JavaScript adds logic to it and CSS makes it visually visually
             appealing or stylish. It controls the layout of a web page i.e. how HTML elements will be 
             displayed on a webpage.</p>
            <p>There are three different ways to add CSS styles to an HTML document, these are -
              <p>
                <li><b>Internal CSS:</b></li><p> Use the style attribute on the HTML element to add styles to the
                  web page. It is used for small projects.</p>
                <li><b>External CSS:</b></li><p> Create a separate CSS file with a .css extension and link this file
                   to your HTML file using the &ltlink> tag.</p>
                <li><b>Inline CSS:</b></li><p> Use the style attribute on the HTML element to add styles to the web page.
                   It is used for small projects.</p></p></p></ul>

            <h2 id="css-resources" style="background-color:peachpuff;">Resources of CSS ?</h2>
            <p>There are many resources available for learning CSS, including:</p>
            <u1>
              <li>Selectors (Basic, Complex)</li>
              <li>Psuedo Selectors</li>
              <li>Layouts: Flex, Grid</li>
              <li>Specificity & Inheritance</li>
